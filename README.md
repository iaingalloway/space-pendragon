## Sarum Family History

### Your Grandfather's History

When the mighty fleets of the **Terran Dominion** withdrew from the Brittania system in year 410 of the Local Reckoning, chaos followed.

Raider flotillas from **Eryne** threatened outlying settlements and trade; from the **Caledon Rim**, the machine-clans of the Outworlds pressed inwards; and mercenary **Saxons** from neighbouring Galena sought to carve out their own fiefdoms upon the rich and undefended moons of Albia.

The **Supreme Collegium** - ancient prefects and stewards of the old Dominion - sent transmission after transmission through the Wyrmgate begging for imperial aid, but none came. Emperor Honorius had no fleets to spare, and his final reply is still preserved in the archives of Sarum Castle:

"Look to your own defences."

From that moment, no Albian world considered itself a province of the Dominion.

The Collegium, struggling to raise a fleet of their own from the scattered remnants of Dominion garrisons and local militias, met in orbit above Caercoulin. After months of debate, they elected **Constantin of Logres** - a noble of vast wealth and renown - as King to unify the defences of the inner worlds.

Constantin decreed that for every ten-thousand souls, a single pilot would be chosen and given stewardship of one of the surviving Dominion **Frames** - ancient mechanical war machines, relics of a bygone age whose machine spirits still answered to the call of a worthy warrior. These chosen defenders became the first **Knights of Logres**.

Amongst those first pilots was your great-grandparent.

Their eldest child - your grandparent - was born into that time of conflict, studying the ways and weapons of warfare. Your grandparent was knighted in 431 by Count Reginald of Salisbury, and proudly took their place in the fleet of King Constantin.

*Choose a name for your great-grandparent, and their eldest child - your grandparent.*

*Calculate your great-grandparent's glory: Your great grandparent died some time shortly before your grandparent was knighted. At the time of their death, their Glory was as follows: 100 for being knighted, plus 1d20x10 for the work of their life.*

*Calculate your grandparent's glory as of 439LR. They begin with 1/10th of their parent's glory, plus 100 for being knighted, plus 2d20 for their own actions thus far.*

Thus begins the recorded history of your line — the first sparks of honour in a darkening sky.
